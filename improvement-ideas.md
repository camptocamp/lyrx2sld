# List of possible improvements

## General
- Add a possibility to log the warnings (currently, they are printed only on errors).
- Add tests.
- Fix the used python version.
- Fix all warnings about style, typo, unused variables, etc.
- Type the code.

## ArcGIS to Geostyler-style
- For ArcGIS to Geostyler-style, convert unit from pt to px systematically.
- Refactor the code in several files (instead of a single very long file)

## To Geostyler-style
- Strict Geostyle-style:
  - Use only (validate ?) variable, type and class existing in geoserver-style.
  - Add a custom file to list "workaround" (not existing) variable, type and class.
